% txtl_prom_ptrc2.m - promoter information for ptrc2 promoter
% RMM, 8 Sep 2012
%
% This file contains a description of the ptrc2 promoter.
% Calling the function txtl_prom_ptrc2() will set up the reactions for
% transcription with the measured binding rates and transription rates.
% The binding of the promoter to the tetR repressor is used in the
% gen_switch example.
